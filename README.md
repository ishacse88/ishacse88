## Hi there 👋 I am a BTech CSE Student

### About Me
I am a BTech Computer Science student with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
I am currently learning and exploring Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing, while building a solid foundation in Python, NumPy, Pandas, and core ML concepts.
I actively work on hands-on projects to understand how machine learning models are built, trained, and evaluated, and how they can be applied to real-world problems.
My GitHub repositories include beginner to intermediate-level projects, practice notebooks, and experiments focused on model development, feature engineering, and performance improvement.
I enjoy learning by building, experimenting with models, and exploring new tools and frameworks. I use GitHub to document my learning journey, share implementations, and track my progress as I grow as an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer.
